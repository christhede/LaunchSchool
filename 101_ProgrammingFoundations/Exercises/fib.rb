# Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the method.

# create an array of fib numbers
# if n == 7, 7 is the 8th index in the array of fibonacci numbers
# iterate through numbers, starting at 1
# use the times method for how many times it will iterate

# fib(8) = 21
# fibonacci(1) == 1
# fibonacci(2) == 1
# fibonacci(3) == 2
# fibonacci(4) == 3
# fibonacci(5) == 5
# fibonacci(12) == 144
# fibonacci(20) == 6765
